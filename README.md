# Image Processing Course Code

TL;DR: This is a repository for the code of my Image Processing course. 

## How to use this repository

There are two tasks in this repository. [Histogram equalization](./histogram_equalization.py) and [image upsampling](./upsample.py).

To run the code, you need to have Python environment installed(My Python version is 3.11.3). And you need to install the dependencies. You can install the dependencies by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
# recommand using conda to install opencv
conda install -c conda-forge opencv==4.7.0
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can run the code by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python histogram_equalization.py
# or
python upsample.py
```
